# AppAcademy-Week4
Week 4 of the FNB App Academy. We dove deeper into web development, using JavaScript to make pages more interactive.
While the lessons are very basic, they are fundamentals. The sturdiest structures are built on firm foundations.
This repo is public so the organisers can moderate my work.
